# Background #
Our tool can automatically generate "meta-invariants" (a.k.a. second-order constraints) that are constraints **about** invariants. For instance, our tool can find the precondition of method foo is stronger than that of method bar with a high degree of precision. Please read [our paper](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kaituo/) for more information.
